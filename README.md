# GP1_RP-TD
This is the our Budget Manager created by Robert Pearson and Tyler Doherty. The goal of the budget manager is to allow people to track and see their monthly expenses and get a sample budget. We included a brief menu that makes the user experience more fluid. 
The repository is split into 3 sections which are the code, our presentation and the project report.
